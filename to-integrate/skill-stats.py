"""Parse agent session files and report skill invocation stats as JSON.

Prototype script — ~0.25s for ~300 sessions on Claude Code.

Integration notes:
  - When incorporating into the product, this should be an SDK operation
    first, then exposed as both a CLI subcommand (`em stats`) and an MCP tool.
  - Must require an agent platform parameter (e.g. "claude", "gemini") to
    decide where to collect stats from. Only one platform per execution.
    Each platform stores sessions differently:
      - Claude Code: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl, <command-name> tags
      - Gemini CLI: TBD — session format and storage path not yet researched
  - The detection method is platform-specific. Claude Code uses <command-name>
    XML tags injected when a skill fires. Other platforms may use different
    markers. Each platform needs its own parser.
  - em is moving to a provider model where platform-specific behavior is
    abstracted behind providers. Session stats collection is a good candidate
    for a provider method — each provider knows where its platform stores
    sessions and how to parse skill invocations from them.
  - See echomodel/echomodel#20 for the full design discussion.
